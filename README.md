# WZULTC Website

This repository contains the source code for the official WZULTC website, hosted at [https://wzultc.org](https://wzultc.org).

## âœ¨ Features

- **Enrollment Page**: A detailed page for recruiting Vietnamese study buddies, available at [wzultc.org/enroll/](https://wzultc.org/enroll/).
- **Latest News**: Section for posting recent announcements and events.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This site is built with simple HTML/CSS and deployed automatically via GitHub Pages.

- **Source**: The content of the `/docs` directory on the `master` branch.
- **Trigger**: Any `git push` to the `master` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.

This setup separates the website's source code (`/docs`) from other project-related files (like this README), keeping the repository clean and organized.
